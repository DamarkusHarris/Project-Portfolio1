Showcasing School Work 

This is to showcase my completed school work. In this Project & Portfolio 1 class I was able to apply my knowledge of OS, networking
and security practices in order to plan a technology solutions based on a typical use case. I had to demonstrate and troubleshoot the design, 
installation and configuration of a working project with servers and user endpoints. 
Also, I have here to show my written project plan documenting my work.

I added some more files that show how I kept track of my project and provided status updates to my client.
